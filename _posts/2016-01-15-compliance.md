# Compliance 

Wise Governance can assist by firstly evaluating the gap between where the organisation is and where it should be with regards to compliance. Wise Governance can then tweak existing and/or develop new systems that can fill that gap, providing your Board with full peace of mind.

_What does your Board need to do to comply with the law, your own policies and best practice?_

_Are risk management systems in place and are they being used?_

_Is the organisation as a whole complying? How do you know?_

_Does your constitution need to be amended?_

_What are the impacts of non-compliance? _

_What are your own time constraints and where is the balance?_
