# Compliance 

What does your Board need to do to comply with the law, your own policies and best practice?

Are risk management systems in place and are they being used?

Is the organisation as a whole complying? How do you know?

Does your constitution need to be amended?

What are the impacts of non-compliance? 

What are your own time constraints and where is the balance?
