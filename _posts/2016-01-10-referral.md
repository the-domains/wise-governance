Wise Governance understands its own
limits of assistance to a Board. If you require assistance to get the right
assistance then Wise Governance will ensure that the scope, or brief,
of work is clear and articulated. 

Wise Governance will also assist with
obtaining competitive quotes from  service providers for your consideration. 

Furthermore,
Wise Governance can be the intermediately between the service provider and the
Board to ensure that the service standards are being met and that you are
getting what you paid for.
