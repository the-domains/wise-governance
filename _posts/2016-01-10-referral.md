Wise Governance understands that sometimes, a specialist referral is
required. 

Wise Governance will ensure that the scope, or brief, of work is both clear
and articulated and will also assist with obtaining competitive quotes from
specialist service providers for your consideration. 

Furthermore, Wise Governance can serve as the intermediary between the
service provider and the Board to ensure that the service standards are being
met and that you are receiving exactly what you ordered.
