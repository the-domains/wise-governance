Wise Governance understands that sometimes a specialist referral is required. 

Wise Governance will ensure that the scope, or brief,
of work is clear and articulated and will also assist with
obtaining competitive quotes from specialist service providers for your consideration. 

Furthermore,
Wise Governance can be the intermediately between the service provider and the
Board to ensure that the service standards are being met and that you are
getting what you paid for.
