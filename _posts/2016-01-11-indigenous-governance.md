## Education

Developing Indigenous directors governance
knowledge has been a passion of both Scott and Annie McCall for over a decade.
Scott and Annie have had the privilege to be able to work with many Indigenous
elders who consistently challenge them to continually break down western law
and governance concepts to make them understandable.

Starting from meta-narratives (the big
stories) of western jurisprudence (philosophy of law), Mulga Gidgee builds a
comprehensive picture of power and how it is exercised in law, society,
politics and organisations, consistently encouraging participants to reflect on
their own cultural governance. From those foundations the training then moves
to the Australian legal system and where the particular organisation's
governance structure fits in. It then looks at legal personality, duties of
directors, and the constitution of the organisation inspiring the on-going
conversations about governance, the Board and what is in the best interest of
the organisation.

Mulga Gidgee's training methodology pivots
on user-driven content. At our core, we recognise the thousands of years of
governance knowledge embedded in all our training participants. Using a
narrative-based training methodology responds to the often-varying literacy
levels in remote communities.
