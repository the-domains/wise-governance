Wise Governance education begins by understanding what a Director already
knows and then builds on that knowledge.

Wise Governance will work with your Board, at their pace and at their
level, in order to maximise impact. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecca159e-592f-4461-96ad-d2836373d8c2.png)

Foundational, practical and/or strategic governance knowledge and skill

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to governance education.
