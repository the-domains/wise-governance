# Education

Wise Governance commences at what a Director already knows and builds on their knowledge.

Wise Governance will work with your Board, at their pace and at their level to maximise impact. 

Foundational, practical and/or strategic governance knowledge and skill levels can be addressed.

There is not a one-size-fits-all approach to governance education.
