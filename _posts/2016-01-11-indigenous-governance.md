# Education

Wise Governance education begins by understanding what a Director already
knows and then builds on that knowledge.

Wise Governance will work with your Board, at their pace and at their
level, in order to maximise impact. 

Foundational, practical and/or strategic governance knowledge and skill levels can be addressed.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to governance education.
